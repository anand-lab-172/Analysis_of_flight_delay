# Analysis_of_flight_delay
* This project is to analyse the delay of the fight and to reduce it
* so I started working with data preprocessing, by splitting catagorical and numerical columns and handling null values and treating the outliers.
* EDA: This section include visualization of data which inlude uni variant visualization, bi-variant visualization and multi-variant visualization.
* As you see this project is full of time series, so i did this project in unspervised learning.
* unpervised learning using kmean clustering and agglomerative  clustering to analyse the data of the flight.
* And to reduce the flight delay based of the analysing.
